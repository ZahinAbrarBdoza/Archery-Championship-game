Firstly, an input will be taken from a user (1 to 5). 
Arrow will be hit on the target accordingly.
Input '5' gives bullseye.
Any input outside the range results in a missed shot.

**Algorithms used**:
  - Midpoint Line (Logo and Score Board)
  - Midpoint Circle (Shooter's head and Target board

**Animation is done using 'Transformation'. Specifically:**
  - Translation (Arrow)
  - Rotation  (Hand)

Finally, after hitting the target, the score will be displayed on the score board.
